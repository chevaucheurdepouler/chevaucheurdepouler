hey! i'm harry123. i have been interested in compsci since years now. i started on an old ibm pc, and here i am, hacking stupid stuff and trying to focus on building interesting things.
These last times, i have been pretty interested by low level languages such as rust, and assembly, peer to peer and alternative networking technologies, and building greener tech.

i also enjoy building more artsy things, and i am curious about everything that comes about music.

you can follow me if you are interested about what i'm building, or even contact me if you need any help!
